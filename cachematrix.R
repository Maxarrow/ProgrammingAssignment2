## This assignment is just to copy the example and change everthing to solve() function.
## What's more important is to understand the thinking behind "cache", and how to make it work in R.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        inv <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                inv <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setinverse <- function(inverse) inv <<- inverse
        getinverse <- function() inv
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setinverse = setinverse,
             getinverse = getinverse)
}

## his function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
##If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.
## For this function, the idea is the same, just copy the function in the example, change everything from mean to solve.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        inv <- x$getinverse()
        if(!is.null(inv)) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(inv)
        }
        data <- x$get()
        inv <- solve(data, ...)
        x$setinverse(m)
        inv
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
